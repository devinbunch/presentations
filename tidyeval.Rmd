# Before we dive into tidyeval...

**rlang** is a toolkit for working with core R and **tidyverse** features, and this hosts the tidy evaluation framework.

**tidyeval** powers packages like **dplyr** and **tidyr** within the scope of the **tidyverse**. It makes it possible to manipulate data frame columns *as if* they were defined in the workspace.

#Is it a package?

#Is it a package?

+ No

#Is it a package?

+ No

+ The tidy eval framework, which is a well-founded system for non-standard evaluation built on quasiquotation (!!) and quosures (quo()).

+ The syntax **!!** is known as "bang bang" (which we will see in use soon)

+ The syntax **{{}}** is known as "curly curly"

+ By adding tidyeval  syntax  to our function assignments, we create a data masking problem that can be solved by implementing **bang bang** and **curly curly** into our function. 
  * Otherwise, we would have to use *$* to  call every variable into a function

---

# Why do we want to know about tidyeval?

+ Makes coding **quicker** and more **convenient**

+ New, unfamiliar syntax introduces two **new programming concepts** (quote and unquote)

+ dplyr uses **data masking**, processed by tidyeval, but invisible to us behind the scenes

# Working Example

background-image: url(https://wallpapercave.com/wp/k7QW6My.jpg) 

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
options(htmltools.dir.version = FALSE)

library(pacman)
p_load(xaringan,tidyverse, dplyr, rlang)

# Starwars Data Set Example

From the base R package, we can import the "starwars" dataset and walk through an example

```{r}
#We can do this by calling it by name (ironic)
starwars
```

---

#Errors?
```{r, error = TRUE}
#Let's first look at the names in our "starwars" data set
names(starwars)

#Now,let's call a column variable from this and see what happens
starships
homeworld
```

+ Although we do this all the time, we cannot call column variables by name outside of dplyr's syntax
+ This is what **tidyeval** works to do in **tidyverse** packages that is usually unbenounced to us

---

#Errors?

+ From **dplyr**, we can use our package commands **group_by** and **summarize** that consider variable names as given in the piped dataset: 

```{r, warning=FALSE}
starwars%>% group_by(mass) %>% summarize(mass_maximum = max(mass, na.rm = TRUE))
```
+ i.e., we do not have to type out
  *starwars[ ,summarize(mass_maximum = max(starwars$mass, na.rm = TRUE)), by = starwars$mass]


--- 

#Errors?

+ Then we can create a function out of our dplyr commands:
```{r}
max_by <- function(data, var, by) {
  data %>%
    group_by(by) %>%
    summarise(maximum = max(var, na.rm = TRUE))
}
```
+ But does this cause problems?

---
# Errors.

+Yes

```{r, error = TRUE}
starwars %>% max_by(mass, by = gender)
```


---

# Errors.

```{r, error = TRUE}
starwars %>% max_by(mass, by = gender)
```
+ What is going on here? **Data masking**

+ Our **dplyr** verbs achieve and bypass the requirement of calling variables from a dataset over and over...

+ The blueprint of our dplyr code resumes its evaluation inside the data mask through pipes (%>%)

+ The example above fails because group_by() is capturing the wrong piece of blueprint
  * It thinks our variable in the data set is literally called "by"

+ This feature is unique to the R language and greatly streamlines the writing and reading of code in interactive scripts. Unfortunately, it also makes it more complex to reuse common patterns inside functions.

# Fix with **!!**

+ To solve this, tidy evaluation provides enquo() to delay the interpretation of code and capture its blueprint, and the surgery operator **!!** for modifying blueprints. 
  *The combination of using enquo() and !! is called the quote-and-unquote pattern:
```{r}
max_by <- function(data, var, by) {
  data %>%
    group_by(!!enquo(by)) %>%
    summarise(maximum = max(!!enquo(var), na.rm = TRUE))
}
```


---

# Fix with **!!**

+ Now let's try to run our function on our data set like before
+ Do we get any errors?
```{r}
starwars %>% max_by(mass, by = gender)
```



---

# Fix with **{{**
### Another interpolation pattern referred to by "curly curly"

+ This operator simplifies writing functions around tidyverse pipelines

```{r}
max_by <- function(data, var, by) {
  data %>%
    group_by({{ by }}) %>%
    summarise(maximum = max({{ var }}, na.rm = TRUE))
}
starwars %>% max_by(height, by = gender)

```

# **tidyeval** fixed our function errors in two ways!
